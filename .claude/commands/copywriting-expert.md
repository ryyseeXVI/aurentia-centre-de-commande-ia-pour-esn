## ✍️ **`/copywriting-expert`** — SaaS Conversion Copywriting

Generate high-converting, psychologically-optimized copy for SaaS landing pages, product pages, and marketing materials using proven frameworks and conversion principles.

### Your Task

When the user requests copywriting assistance:

1. **Analyze the context**:
   - Identify the page type (landing, pricing, feature, about, FAQ, email, etc.)
   - Detect if existing copy exists (audit mode) or needs generation (create mode)
   - Understand the product/service from codebase context (CLAUDE.md, existing pages, components)
   - Identify the target audience and their primary jobs-to-be-done
   - Determine the conversion goal (sign-up, trial, purchase, engagement, retention)
   - Assess the current stage in the user journey (awareness, consideration, decision, retention)

2. **Select optimal framework(s)**:
   Choose the most effective copywriting framework(s) for the context:

   - **Jobs-to-be-Done (JTBD)**: Best for feature pages, use cases, and outcome-focused messaging
     - Focus on the progress users are trying to make
     - Emphasize outcomes over features ("Stop losing registrations" vs "Automated tournament management")
     - Map emotional and functional jobs

   - **Problem-Agitate-Solution (PAS)**: Best for landing pages and pain-point driven marketing
     - Identify the core problem clearly and specifically
     - Agitate with consequences and missed opportunities
     - Present solution as the natural resolution

   - **StoryBrand (SB7)**: Best for hero sections, about pages, and brand narrative
     - Position user as the hero (not the product)
     - Product is the guide helping them succeed
     - Clear plan and call to action

   - **AIDA (Attention-Interest-Desire-Action)**: Best for email sequences and conversion funnels
     - Grab attention with compelling hook
     - Build interest with benefits
     - Create desire with social proof/urgency
     - Drive action with clear CTA

   - **Feature-Advantage-Benefit (FAB)**: Best for pricing pages and product comparisons
     - Feature: What it is
     - Advantage: Why it's better
     - Benefit: What the user gains

   - **Hybrid approach**: Combine frameworks for maximum impact (e.g., SB7 hero + PAS features + JTBD outcomes)

3. **Analyze psychological triggers**:
   Identify and leverage conversion psychology principles:

   - **Social Proof**: Testimonials, user counts, case studies, trust badges, review scores
   - **Scarcity**: Limited time offers, exclusive access, remaining spots
   - **Urgency**: Time-sensitive promotions, seasonal relevance, competitive disadvantage of waiting
   - **Authority**: Industry expertise, certifications, partnerships, media mentions
   - **Reciprocity**: Free tools, resources, trials before asking for commitment
   - **Loss Aversion**: What they'll miss out on, current pain staying unresolved
   - **Commitment & Consistency**: Progressive micro-commitments leading to conversion
   - **Cognitive Ease**: Simple language, clear value prop, reducing mental effort
   - **Anchoring**: Price comparisons, value perception, feature tiering

4. **Generate or audit copy** (context-dependent):

   **For new copy generation**:
   - **Hero Section**:
     - Headline: Value proposition in ≤10 words (clear, specific, outcome-focused)
     - Subheadline: Expand on who it's for and primary benefit (15-25 words)
     - Primary CTA: Action-oriented, specific ("Start your free tournament" vs "Get started")
     - Secondary CTA: Lower commitment alternative ("See how it works", "View demo")
     - Hero copy: 1-2 sentences max, focus on transformation

   - **Features/Benefits Section**:
     - Transform features into benefits using JTBD framework
     - Use power words and sensory language
     - Include specific outcomes (numbers, time saved, growth achieved)
     - Structure: Problem → Solution → Outcome

   - **Social Proof Section**:
     - Testimonial structure: Situation → Problem → Solution → Result
     - Specific metrics ("increased registrations 3x" vs "improved results")
     - Include role/company for credibility
     - User photos for authenticity

   - **Pricing Section**:
     - Frame pricing around value, not cost
     - Use anchoring (show most expensive first or highlight mid-tier)
     - Remove friction ("No credit card required", "Cancel anytime")
     - Feature benefits not features in plan details
     - Clear CTA per tier with specific action

   - **FAQ Section**:
     - Address real objections preventing conversion
     - Reframe concerns into benefits
     - Use conversational, reassuring tone
     - End with CTA or next step

   - **Email Sequences**:
     - Subject lines: Curiosity + benefit + urgency (keep <50 chars)
     - Preheader: Complement subject, not repeat it
     - Body: One clear purpose per email
     - Personalization beyond first name (behavior, usage, goals)
     - Progressive value: Educate → Activate → Convert → Retain

   **For copy audit**:
   - **Clarity Score**: Is the value proposition immediately clear? (1-10)
   - **Conversion Friction**: Identify barriers (jargon, length, unclear CTAs, weak benefits)
   - **Message Hierarchy**: Is the most important info first? Scannable structure?
   - **Tone Consistency**: Matches brand voice? Appropriate for audience maturity?
   - **CTA Effectiveness**: Specific, action-oriented, benefits-focused?
   - **Emotional Resonance**: Does it connect with user's aspirations/fears?
   - **Improvement Suggestions**: Specific rewrites with rationale
   - **A/B Test Variants**: Provide 2-3 variations for key elements testing different psychological triggers

5. **Follow SaaS copywriting best practices**:
   - **Clarity over cleverness**: Be direct, avoid puns unless brand-appropriate
   - **Specificity over generics**: "Save 5 hours/week" not "Save time"
   - **Benefits over features**: Lead with outcome, support with how
   - **Active voice**: "Launch tournaments in 3 clicks" not "Tournaments can be launched"
   - **Power words**: Strategic use without overselling (transform, instant, proven, effortless, guaranteed)
   - **Readability**: 8th-grade reading level, short sentences (avg 15-20 words), short paragraphs (3-4 lines)
   - **Scannability**: Bullet points, bolding key phrases, clear headings
   - **Conversational tone**: Write like you speak, use "you" and "your"
   - **Removal of hedging**: "Might help" → "Helps", "Try to" → "Do"
   - **Negative space**: Don't over-explain, let copy breathe

6. **Optimize for conversion metrics**:
   - **Above the fold**: Value prop + CTA visible without scrolling
   - **CTA placement**: Primary CTA in hero, repeat every 1-2 screens, different angles
   - **Button copy**: First-person works better ("Start my free trial" vs "Start your trial")
   - **Microcopy**: Error messages, loading states, success confirmations (friendly, helpful, on-brand)
   - **Trust indicators**: Near CTAs and pricing (security badges, money-back guarantee, user count)
   - **Visual hierarchy**: Most important = largest/boldest, guide eye path to CTA
   - **Mobile-first**: Shorter headlines, fewer words, thumb-friendly CTA buttons

7. **Adapt tone to SaaS context**:
   - **B2B SaaS**: Professional but approachable, ROI-focused, industry-specific language acceptable
   - **B2C SaaS**: Friendly, personal, everyday language, emotional benefits prominent
   - **PLG (Product-Led Growth)**: Focus on quick value, self-service, "try it now" mentality
   - **Enterprise**: Trust, security, integration, support, case studies, ROI calculators
   - **Freemium**: Highlight free value, gentle upgrade nudges, feature-gating clarity
